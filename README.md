- 📦 **Webpack dev server support** with compilation monitoring
- 🔐 **Credential copying** (.env, Rails credentials, master.key)
- 📁 **IDE configuration copying** (.vscode, etc.)
- 🌐 **Auto browser opening** when Rails server is ready
- 📋 **Log management** with easy viewing commands
- 🧹 **Clean removal** with server shutdown and branch cleanup
- 📊 **Server monitoring** and listing capabilities

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone or download the git-worktree-helper
cd git-worktree-helper
./install.sh
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# Copy the script to your PATH
sudo cp bin/wt /usr/local/bin/wt
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wt

# Verify installation
wt --help
```

## Usage

### Create a New Worktree

```bash
# Create worktree for a new feature
wt my-feature

# This will:
# 1. Create a new branch 'my-feature'
# 2. Create worktree in ../project-name-worktrees/my-feature/
# 3. Copy .env, credentials, and IDE configs
# 4. Install dependencies (bundle install, yarn install)
# 5. Start Rails server on available port (3001+)
# 6. Start Webpack dev server if available
# 7. Open in Cursor editor
# 8. Open browser when Rails is ready
```

### Manage Worktrees

```bash
# List all running servers
wt list

# View Rails logs
wt logs my-feature

# View Webpack logs
wt webpack-logs my-feature

# Stop servers in current worktree
wt stop

# Remove worktree and stop servers
wt remove my-feature

# Merge feature and cleanup
wt merge my-feature main

# Remove ALL worktrees (careful!)
wt cleanup-all
```

## How It Works

### Directory Structure

When you run `wt my-feature` in a project located at `/path/to/myproject/`, it creates:

```
/path/to/
├── myproject/                 # Original project
└── myproject-worktrees/       # Worktrees directory
    └── my-feature/            # Your feature worktree
        ├── .env               # Copied from main
        ├── config/
        │   ├── credentials.yml.enc
        │   └── master.key
        ├── tmp/
        │   ├── .rails_pid
        │   ├── .rails_port
        │   ├── rails.log
        │   └── webpack.log
        └── ...                # Full project files
```

### Smart Port Allocation

- **Rails servers**: Start from port 3001, auto-increment if busy
- **Webpack servers**: Start from port 3036, auto-increment if busy
- **Main project**: Preserves ports 3000 (Rails) and 3035 (Webpack)

### Automatic File Copying

The tool automatically copies essential files from the main project:

- **Environment**: `.env`
- **Rails credentials**: `config/credentials.yml.enc`, `config/master.key`
- **IDE configs**: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.
- **GitHub**: `.github/`

## Requirements

- **Git** with worktree support
- **Ruby/Rails** projects: `bundle` command available
- **Node.js** projects: `yarn` command available
- **macOS/Linux**: Uses `lsof` for port detection
- **Optional**: `cursor` command for editor integration

## Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
cd ~/projects/my-rails-app
wt user-authentication

# Your feature worktree is created and Rails starts on port 3001
# Browser opens to http://localhost:3001
# Cursor editor opens the worktree

# Work on your feature...

# When done, merge and cleanup
wt merge user-authentication main

# Or just remove without merging
wt remove user-authentication
```

### Multiple Features

```bash
# Work on multiple features simultaneously
wt feature-a    # Rails on port 3001
wt feature-b    # Rails on port 3002
wt feature-c    # Rails on port 3003

# List all running servers
wt list

# Switch between worktrees by cd'ing to them
cd ../my-rails-app-worktrees/feature-a/
cd ../my-rails-app-worktrees/feature-b/

# Clean up when done
wt remove feature-a
wt remove feature-b
wt remove feature-c
```

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# View Rails logs in real-time
wt logs my-feature

# View Webpack compilation logs
wt webpack-logs my-feature

# From within a worktree directory
cd ../my-project-worktrees/my-feature/
wt logs        # Auto-detects feature name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If `wt` command is not found after installation:

```bash
# Check if /usr/local/bin is in PATH
echo $PATH

# Add to PATH if missing (choose your shell)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc   # Zsh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Bash

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### Server Won't Start

If Rails/Webpack servers fail to start:

```bash
# Check logs
tail -f tmp/rails.log
tail -f tmp/webpack.log

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3001

# Stop conflicting processes
wt list
wt stop
```

### Permission Issues

If you get permission errors during installation:

```bash
# Ensure you have write access to /usr/local/bin
ls -la /usr/local/bin/

# Or install to a different directory
cp bin/wt ~/bin/wt  # If ~/bin is in your PATH
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Run the uninstaller
./uninstall.sh

# Or remove manually
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/wt
```
